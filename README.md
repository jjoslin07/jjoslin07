Hello, my name is Joseph and Iâ€™m currently making the transition from Distribution and Logistics into the Software Engineering field with a focus in Web Development. I recently graduated from the Open Classrooms Web Developer bootcamp, and Iâ€™ve been doing everything I can to improve my skills and gain exposure. I am also an undergrad at WGU for Software Engineering with an expected graduation date of March 2026. I have produced and released content that is currently in use today (see below). Thank you for reviewing my profile!
